<h2>Conspecificity of two pocket mice,<br />
Perognathus goldmani and P. artus</h2>

<p class="center">BY<br /><br />

E. RAYMOND HALL AND MARILYN BAILEY OGILVIE</p>


<p><i>Perognathus goldmani</i> Osgood and <i>Perognathus artus</i> Osgood
from southern Sonora, northern Sinaloa and adjoining parts of
Chihuahua and Durango, are two named kinds of the <i>Perognathus
intermedius</i> group of pocket mice, of the subgenus <i>Chaetodipus</i>.
Until now the two kinds have been treated in the literature as two
species. In both <i>goldmani</i> and <i>artus</i> the upper parts are Ochraceous-Buff
(capitalized color terms after Ridgway, Color Standards and
Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912) having a strong
admixture of black. The lateral line is Ochraceous-Buff, and the
underparts are white. <i>P. goldmani</i> is larger than <i>P. artus</i> (see
measurements beyond) and has more inflated tympanic bullae and
a relatively narrower (transverse to long axis of skull) interparietal
bone.</p>

<p>Specimens from a transect of southeastern Sonora show intergradation
between <i>Perognathus goldmani</i> and <i>P. artus</i>. From
northwest to southeast the specimens are as follows: one mile east
of Buena Vista, on R&iacute;o Yaqui Reservoir, 1000 feet (2 specimens,
K. U.); Alamos, 1200 feet (7, U. S. B. S.); four and a half miles
southeast of Alamos, 1000 feet (5, K. U.); nine miles southeast
Alamos, 1000 feet (5, K. U.). The specimens (<i>P. goldmani</i>) from
R&iacute;o Yaqui Reservoir are largest. Those from nine miles southeast
of Alamos (<i>P. artus</i>) are smallest. Those from Alamos proper are
<i>P. goldmani</i>. Those from four and a half miles southeast of Alamos
(80051-80055 K. U. collected by Robert L. Packard and here referred
to <i>goldmani</i>) include two as large as <i>goldmani</i> from Alamos,
one as small as <i>artus</i> from nine miles southeast of Alamos, and two
that are intermediate in size. Features other than size, considered
geographically, also suggest intergradation.</p>

<p>Six specimens (61409-61413, 61415 K. U. collected by J. R.
Alcorn), including five adults (permanent fourth premolar of full
height and having cusps worn but not so much as to make a lake
of dentine), from four miles north of Terrero, Sinaloa, also seem
to be intergrades between <i>Perognathus goldmani</i> and <i>Perognathus
artus</i>. As compared with adults of <i>P. goldmani</i> from 10 miles north-northwest
of Los Mochis, Sinaloa, and <i>P. artus</i> from one mile south<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
of Pericos, Sinaloa, the specimens from four miles north of Terrero
are almost exactly intermediate in length of hind foot, width of
interparietal, and width of tympanic bullae. Intermediacy is shown
also in total length of animal (slightly nearer that of <i>artus</i>) and
length of tympanic bullae (slightly nearer that of <i>goldmani</i>). In
lack of inflation laterally of the mastoidal bullae the specimens
agree with <i>artus</i>. In occipitonasal length and mastoidal breadth
the specimens from four miles north of Terrero average even larger
than <i>goldmani</i> from 10 miles north-northwest of Los Mochis but
not so large as specimens of <i>goldmani</i> from the type locality, which
is still farther north. The uninflated mastoidal bullae "tip the
balance" slightly in favor of <i>artus</i>
to which the specimens from
four miles north of Terrero are
here referred. The degree of
inflation of the mastoidal bullae
elsewhere varies geographically.
For example, the mastoidal bullae
of the 25 specimens of <i>goldmani</i>
from two and a half miles
north of El Fuerte, Sinaloa, are
intermediate in size as between
those of <i>goldmani</i> and <i>artus</i>.</p>

<p>The morphological intermediacy
of the specimens from four
and a half miles southeast of
Alamos and of those from four
miles north of Terrero, along
with the geographic intermediacy
of the two localities where
the specimens were obtained
constitute basis for arranging
<i>artus</i> as a subspecies of <i>goldmani</i>
that has one page of priority.</p>

<h3>Perognathus goldmani artus <span style="font-weight: normal">Osgood</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Perognathus artus</i> Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 18:55, September 20, 1900, type
from Batopilas, Chihuahua.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;See <a href="#map1">map 1</a>.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;Average of five adult topotypes (Osgood, <i>op. cit.</i>:55, 63):
total length, 191; tail vertebrae, 106; hind foot, 24.6; occipitonasal length, 25.4;
mastoidal breadth, 12.4; greatest width of interparietal, 7.1.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Considerable individual variation has been noted in
each of several populations of <i>Perognathus goldmani artus</i>. For
example, in 14 adults from Culiac&aacute;n, Sinaloa, the variation is 25.0
to 27.9 in occipitonasal length and in mastoidal breadth is 12.6 to
14.0. Ten specimens (83122-83131 Univ. Mich.) labeled as from
Carimechi, R&iacute;o Mayo, Chi[huahua], were recorded by Burt and
Hooper (Occas. Papers Mus. Zool., Univ. Michigan, 430:6, May 27,
1941) as from "near Carimechi." They identified the two largest
(83130 and 83131) as <i>Perognathus goldmani</i> and the others as
<i>Perognathus artus</i>. These identifications were reasonable in the
light of knowledge available in 1941, but in the light of information
presently available from the now more abundant material it is clear
that all 10 of the specimens are <i>P. g. artus</i>. Examination (by Hall)
of the specimens reveals that the differences relied upon by Burt
and Hooper to differentiate the two species are well within the
range of individual variation. For example, the variation (5.3 to
5.6 mm.) in width of the supraoccipital is less than in each of some
other series of specimens of equal age of <i>P. g. artus</i> from other
localities.</p>

<p>Also, there is geographic variation in the mice here assigned to
the subspecies <i>P. g. artus</i>; skulls are smaller in the northern part of
the geographic range and become gradually larger toward the south.
In five adults from the northern part (Batopilas 3, and 26 mi. NE
Choix 2) the mean of 12.6 of the mastoidal breadth of the skull is
significantly smaller than the corresponding mean of 13.3 in 21
adults from the southern part (32 mi. SSE Culiac&aacute;n 14, and El
Dorado 7). The pelage of individuals from one and a half miles
southwest of Tocuina is notably dark both above and below; the
venter is dusky rather than white. We suppose that the darker<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
color is a response to a dark-colored substrate&mdash;lava and soils derived
from dark lava.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Records of occurrence</i> (in each state the localities are listed from north to
south).&mdash;Chihuahua: Carimechi, R&iacute;o Mayo, 10 U. Mich.; 1-1/2 mi. SW Tocuina
[Tocuina is a construction camp, in 1959, on NW bank of the R&iacute;o Septentri&oacute;n,
and is not the Tacuina shown on some maps SE of that River], 10 K. U.; Batopilas,
6 U. S. N. M. Durango: Chacala (Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 18:55,
September 20, 1900). Sinaloa: Rancho Rosalita, 26 mi. NE Choix, 3 K. U.;
4 mi. NE Terrero, 6 K. U.; 1 mi. S Pericos, 20 K. U.; 12 mi. N Culiac&aacute;n, 29
K. U.; 32 mi. SSE Culiac&aacute;n, 20 K. U.; 6 mi. N, 1/2 mi. E El Dorado, 41 K. U.;
El Dorado, 2 K. U. Sonora: R&iacute;o "Cuchahaque," 11.3 mi. E Alamos, 5 Univ.
Arizona; 9 mi. SE Alamos, 1000 ft., 5 K. U.</p></div>

<p>We have not seen any specimens that are intergrades between
<i>P. goldmani</i> and <i>Perognathus intermedius</i> (subspecies <i>intermedius</i>
or <i>lithophilus</i>), nor between <i>P. goldmani</i> and <i>Perognathus nelsoni</i>
(subspecies <i>nelsoni</i> or <i>canescens</i>), nor between <i>P. intermedius</i> and
<i>P. nelsoni</i>. Collecting and studying specimens from geographically
appropriate places to test for intergradation between these three
species would be worthwhile as a means of improving our knowledge
of the taxonomy of these mice.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We are obliged to J. R. Alcorn and William L. Cutter for collecting many
of the specimens used by us, to the Watkins Fund of the Kansas University
Endowment Association and to the American Heart Fund for financial assistance
with collecting the specimens, to the National Science Foundation for financial
assistance with study of the specimens in the Museum, to William H. Burt
of the University of Michigan, and to Stanley P. Young, Richard P. Manville
and Viola S. Schantz of the Biological Surveys Collection of the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service for lending certain specimens.</p></div>
